Hi Max.  For this project, as we talked about this morning, I think that the first things to do are to get gacode working on IRIS and to run some simple linear cgyro cases.  Then we can start running some experimental NSTX cases and thinking about the model.

For set-up on IRIS, you will need to add the following to your .bashrc:

module load defaults
module load atom/dev
export GACODE_PLATFORM=SATURN_GCC
export GACODE_ROOT=/fusion/projects/codes/atom/dev/atom_SATURN_GCC/gacode
. ${GACODE_ROOT}/shared/bin/gacode_setup

Then you can run the cgyro regression set:
>> cgyro -r -n 2

This will create a directory of simple cgyro tests “cgyro_regression_test” and run then and all should print “PASS”
